- 👋  Hi, I’m @tiagovpt (Tiago Volpato, but better known as Tico). I'm Master in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo and Ph.D. Candidate at the same University 🎓
- 👨🏼‍💻  I also work as a Technical Writer on the [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/) Infrastructure team. 
It's a purple world where you feel like on the first day of work every day. I have learned a lot and shared knowledge with amazing people. 
- ⌛️  In my free time, I like to exercise 🏋🏼‍♂️, run 🏃🏼‍♂️, meditate 🧘🏼‍♂️, and spend time choosing what to watch on Netflix.
